## 🎨 Prompt Engineering

### Advanced Prompt Structure

Our sophisticated prompt engineering follows a multi-layered approach:

```python
def create_advanced_prompt(
    self,
    task_description: str,
    input_data: Any,
    context: Dict[str, Any] = None,
    examples: List[Dict[str, str]] = None,
    constraints: List[str] = None
) -> str:
    # 1. System prompt with reasoning framework
    # 2. Task-specific prompt with context
    # 3. Reasoning instructions
    # 4. Examples and constraints
    # 5. Output format specification
```

### Reasoning Frameworks

#### Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
```
REASONING APPROACH:
1. ANALYSIS: Break down the input into key components
2. EVALUATION: Assess each component against relevant criteria
3. SYNTHESIS: Combine insights to form comprehensive understanding
4. VALIDATION: Cross-check conclusions against best practices
5. RECOMMENDATION: Provide actionable next steps with confidence levels
```

#### Multi-Perspective Analysis
```
REASONING APPROACH:
1. CANDIDATE PERSPECTIVE: How does this benefit the job seeker?
2. RECRUITER PERSPECTIVE: What would hiring managers look for?
3. INDUSTRY PERSPECTIVE: How does this align with current trends?
4. TECHNICAL PERSPECTIVE: Are the skills and qualifications accurate?
5. STRATEGIC PERSPECTIVE: What are the long-term implications?
```

## ⚡ Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy

- **Context-Aware Keys**: MD5 hashing of prompt + context
- **Intelligent Invalidation**: Time-based and content-based expiration
- **Hit Rate Optimization**: Performance metrics tracking

### Parallel Processing

- **Adaptive Execution**: Dynamic decision between parallel/sequential
- **Resource Management**: ThreadPoolExecutor with configurable workers
- **Failure Handling**: Graceful degradation with partial results

### Quality Thresholds

```python
quality_thresholds = {
    "minimum_confidence": 70,
    "maximum_response_time": 30,
    "minimum_success_rate": 80
}
```

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Agent Performance Tracking
